                            Works in both Firefox and Chrome. Firefox supports both hardware accelerated rendering and
                            software rendering. Chrome only seems to support hardware accelerated. Therefore, if you are
                            using this in a Remote Desktop session, you might want to try to use Firefox if you want to
                            use the 3D rendering.
